'''Anarchism''' is a [[political philosophy]] and [[Political movement|movement]] that rejects all involuntary, coercive forms of [[hierarchy]]. It [[Radical politics|radically]] calls for the abolition of the [[State (polity)|state]] which it holds to be undesirable, unnecessary and harmful.

The [[timeline of anarchism]] stretches back to [[prehistory]] when people lived in anarchistic societies long before the establishment of formal states, [[Realm|kingdom]]s or [[empire]]s. With the rise of organised hierarchical bodies, [[skepticism]] towards authority also rose, but it was not until the 19th century a self-conscious political movement was formed. During the latest half of 19th and the first decades of 20th century, the anarchist movement flourished in most parts of the world and had a significant role in worker's struggles for emancipation. Various [[branches of anarchism]] were espoused during those times. Anarchists took part in several revolutions, most notably in the [[Spanish Civil War]], where they were crushed by the [[fascists|fascist]] forces in 1939, marking the end of the [[classical era of anarchism]]. In the last decades of the 20th century and into the 21st century, the anarchist movement has been resurgent once more.

Anarchism employs various tactics in order to meet its ideal ends; these can be broadly separated in revolutionary and evolutionary tactics. There is significant overlap between the two legs which are merely descriptive. Revolutionary tactics aim to bring down authority and state, and have taken a violent turn in the past. Evolutionary tactics aim to prefigure what an anarchist society would be like. Anarchist thought, criticism and praxis has played a part in diverse fields of human society.

Criticism of anarchism mainly focuses on it being internally inconsistent, violent and utopian.

== Etymology, terminology and definition ==
{{main|Definition of anarchism}}
{{see also|Anarchist terminology}}
The etymological origin of ''anarchism'' is from the Ancient Greek ''anarkhia'', meaning &quot;without a ruler&quot;, composed of the prefix ''an-'' (i.e. &quot;without&quot;) and the word ''arkhos'' (i.e. &quot;leader&quot; or &quot;ruler&quot;). The suffix ''[[-ism]]'' denotes the ideological current that favours [[anarchy]].{{sfnm|1a1=Bates|1y=2017|1p=128|2a1=Long|2y=2013|2p=217}} ''Anarchism'' appears in English from 1642{{sfn|Merriam-Webster|2019|loc=&quot;Anarchism&quot;}} as ''anarchisme'' and ''anarchy'' from 1539.{{sfn|Oxford English Dictionary|2005|loc=&quot;Anarchism&quot;}} Various factions within the [[French Revolution]] labelled their opponents as ''anarchists'', although few such accused shared many views with later anarchists. Many revolutionaries of the 19th century such as [[William Godwin]] (1756–1836) and [[Wilhelm Weitling]] (1808–1871) would contribute to the anarchist doctrines of the next generation, but they did not use ''anarchist'' or ''anarchism'' in describing themselves or their beliefs.{{sfn|Joll|1964|pp=27–37}}

The first political philosopher to call himself an ''anarchist'' ({{lang-fr|anarchiste}}) was [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] (1809–1865), marking the formal birth of anarchism in the mid-19th century. Since the 1890s and beginning in France,{{sfn|Nettlau|1996|p=162}} ''[[libertarianism]]'' has often been used as a synonym for anarchism{{sfn|Guerin|1970|loc=&quot;The Basic Ideas of Anarchism&quot;}} and its use as a synonym is still common outside the United States.{{sfnm|1a1=Ward|1y=2004|1p=62|2a1=Goodway|2y=2006|2p=4|3a1=Skirda|3y=2002|3p=183|4a1=Fernández|4y=2009|4p=9}} On the other hand, some use ''libertarianism'' to refer to [[Individualist anarchism|individualistic free-market philosophy]] only, referring to [[free-market anarchism]] as ''libertarian anarchism''.{{sfn|Morris|2002|p=61}}

While [[Anti-statism|opposition to the state]] is central to anarchist thought, defining anarchism is not an easy task as there is a lot of talk among scholars and anarchists on the matter and various currents perceive anarchism slightly differently.{{sfn|Long|2013|p=217}} Hence, it might be true to say that anarchism is a cluster of political philosophies opposing [[authority]] and [[hierarchical organization]] (including the [[State (polity)|state]], [[Anarchism and capitalism|capitalism]], [[Anarchism and nationalism|nationalism]] and all associated [[institution]]s) in the conduct of all [[human relations]] in favour of a society based on [[voluntary association]], on [[freedom]] and on [[decentralisation]], but this definition has the same shortcomings as the definition based on etymology (which is simply a negation of a ruler), or based on anti-statism (anarchism is much more than that) or even the anti-authoritarian (which is an ''a posteriori'' conclusion).{{sfnm|1a1=McLaughlin|1y=2007|1pp=25–29|2a1=Long|2y=2013|2pp=217}} Nonetheless, major elements of the definition of anarchism include the following:{{sfn|McLaughlin|2007|pp=25–26}}
# The will for a non-coercive society.
# The rejection of the state apparatus.
# The belief that human nature allows humans to exist in or progress toward such a non-coercive society.
# A suggestion on how to act to pursue the ideal of anarchy.

== History ==
{{main|History of anarchism}}

=== Pre-modern era ===
[[File:Paolo Monti - Servizio fotografico (Napoli, 1969) - BEIC 6353768.jpg|thumb|upright=.7|[[Zeno of Citium]] (c. 334 – c. 262 BC), whose ''[[Republic (Zeno)|Republic]]'' inspired [[Peter Kropotkin]]{{sfn|Marshall|1993|p=70}}]]
During the prehistoric era of mankind, an established authority did not exist. It was after the creation of towns and cities that institutions of authority were established and anarchistic ideas espoused as a reaction.{{sfn|Graham|2005|pp=xi–xiv}} Most notable precursors to anarchism in the ancient world were in [[History of China|China]] and [[Ancient Greece|Greece]]. In China, [[philosophical anarchism]] (i.e. the discussion on the legitimacy of the state) was delineated by [[Taoism|Taoist philosophers]] [[Zhuang Zhou|Zhuangzi]] and [[Lao Tzu]].{{sfnm|1a1=Coutinho|1y=2016|2a1=Marshall|2y=1993|2p=54}} Likewise, anarchic attitudes were articulated by tragedians and philosophers in Greece. [[Aeschylus]] and [[Sophocles]] used the myth of [[Antigone]] to illustrate the conflict between rules set by the state and [[autonomy|personal autonomy]]. [[Socrates]] questioned Athenian authorities constantly and insisted to the right of individual freedom of consciousness. [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynics]] dismissed human law (''nomos'') and associated authorities while trying to live according to nature (''physis''). [[Stoics]] were supportive of a society based on unofficial and friendly relations among its citizens without the presence of a state.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=4, 66–73}}

During the [[Middle Ages]], there was no anarchistic activity except some ascetic religious movements in the Islamic world or in Christian Europe. This kind of tradition later gave birth to [[religious anarchism]]. In Persia, [[Mazdak]] called for an [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian society]] and the [[abolition of monarchy]], only to be soon executed by the king.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|p=86}} In [[Basra]], religious sects preached against the state. In Europe, various sects developed anti-state and libertarian tendencies. Libertarian ideas further emerged during the [[Renaissance]] with the spread of [[Rationalism|reasoning]] and [[humanism]] through Europe. Novelists fictionalised ideal societies that were based not on coercion but voluntarism. The [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] further pushed towards anarchism with the optimism for social progress.{{sfn|Adams|2014|pp=33–63}}

=== Modern era ===
During the [[French Revolution]], the partisan groups of [[Enragés]] and {{lang|fr|[[sans-culottes]]}} saw a turning point in the fermentation of anti-state and federalist sentiments.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|p=4}} The first anarchist currents developed throughout the 18th century—[[William Godwin]] espoused [[philosophical anarchism]] in England, morally delegitimizing the state, [[Max Stirner]]'s thinking paved the way to individualism, and [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]]'s theory of [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]] found fertile soil in France.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=4–5}} This era of classical anarchism lasted until the end of the Spanish Civil War of 1936 and is considered the golden age of anarchism.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=4–5}}

[[File:Bakunin.png|thumb|upright|Anarchist [[Mikhail Bakunin]] opposed the [[Marxism|Marxist]] aim of [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] and allied himself with the federalists in the [[International Workingmen's Association|First International]] before his expulsion by the Marxists]]
Drawing from mutualism, [[Mikhail Bakunin]] founded [[collectivist anarchism]] and entered the [[International Workingmen's Association]], a class worker union later known as the First International that formed in 1864 to unite diverse revolutionary currents. The International became a significant political force, and [[Karl Marx]] a leading figure and a member of its General Council. Bakunin's faction, the [[Jura Federation]] and Proudhon's followers, the [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualists]], opposed Marxist [[state socialism]], advocating political [[abstentionism]] and small property holdings.{{sfnm|1a1=Dodson|1y=2002|1p=312|2a1=Thomas|2y=1985|2p=187|3a1=Chaliand|3a2=Blin|3y=2007|3p=116}} After bitter disputes the Bakuninists were expelled from the International by the Marxists at the [[1872 Hague Congress]].{{sfnm|1a1=Graham|1y=2019|1pp=334–336|2a1=Marshall|2y=1993|2p=24}} Bakunin famously predicted that if revolutionaries gained power by Marxist's terms, they would end up the new tyrants of workers. After being expelled, anarchists formed the [[Anarchist St. Imier International|St. Imier International]]. Under the influence of [[Peter Kropotkin]], a Russian philosopher and scientist, [[anarcho-communism]] overlapped with collectivism.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|p=5}} Anarcho-communists, who drew inspiration from the 1871 [[Paris Commune]], advocated for free federation and distribution of goods according to one's needs.{{sfn|Graham|2005|p=xii}}

At the turning of the century, anarchism had spread all over the world.{{sfn|Moya|2015|p=327}} In China, small groups of students imported the humanistic pro-science version of anarcho-communism.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=519–521}} Tokyo was a hotspot for rebellious youth from countries of the far east, pouring into the Japanese capital to study.{{sfnm|1a1=Dirlik|1y=1991|1p=133|2a1=Ramnath|2y=2019|2pp=681–682}} In [[Latin America]], [[Anarchism in Argentina|São Paulo]] was a stronghold for anarcho-syndicalism where it became the most prominent left-wing ideology.{{sfnm|1a1=Levy|1y=2011|1p=23|2a1=Laursen|2y=2019|2p=157|3a1=Marshall|3y=1993|3pp=504–508}} During this time, a minority of anarchists adopted tactics of revolutionary [[political violence]]. This strategy became known as [[propaganda of the deed]].{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=633–636}} The dismemberment of the French socialist movement into many groups and the execution and exile of many [[Communards]] to penal colonies following the suppression of the Paris Commune favoured individualist political expression and acts.{{sfn|Anderson|2004}} Even though many anarchists distanced themselves from these terrorist acts, infamy came upon the movement.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=633–636}} [[Illegalism]] was another strategy which some anarchists adopted these same years.{{sfn|Bantman|2019|p=374}}

[[File:Makhno group.jpg|thumb|left|[[Nestor Makhno]] with members of the anarchist [[Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine]]]]
Anarchists enthusiastically participated in the [[Russian Revolution]]—despite concerns—in opposition to the [[White movement|Whites]]. However, they met harsh suppression after the [[Bolshevik government]] was stabilized. Several anarchists from Petrograd and Moscow fled to Ukraine,{{sfn|Avrich|2006|p=204}} notably leading to the [[Kronstadt rebellion]] and [[Nestor Makhno]]'s struggle in the [[Free Territory]]. With the anarchists being crushed in Russia, two new antithetical currents emerged, namely [[platformism]] and [[synthesis anarchism]]. The former sought to create a coherent group that would push for the revolution while the latter were against anything that would resemble a political party. Seeing the victories of the Bolsheviks in the [[October Revolution]] and the resulting [[Russian Civil War]], many workers and activists turned to [[Communist party|communist parties]] which grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements. In France and the United States, members of major syndicalist movements, the [[General Confederation of Labour (France)|General Confederation of Labour]] and [[Industrial Workers of the World]], left their organisations and joined the [[Communist International]].{{sfn|Nomad|1966|p=88}}

In the [[Spanish Civil War]], anarchists and syndicalists ([[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]] and [[Federación Anarquista Ibérica|FAI]]) once again allied themselves with various currents of leftists. A long tradition of [[Spanish anarchism]] led to anarchists playing a pivotal role in the war. In response to the army rebellion, an anarchist-inspired movement of peasants and workers, supported by armed militias, took control of [[Barcelona]] and of large areas of rural Spain where they [[Collective farming|collectivised]] the land.{{sfn|Bolloten|1984|p=1107}} The Soviet Union provided some limited assistance at the beginning of the war, but the result was a bitter fight among communists and anarchists at a series of events named [[May Days]] as [[Joseph Stalin]] tried to seize control of the [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republicans]].{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=xi, 466}}

=== Post-war era ===
[[File:Rojava Sewing Cooperative.jpg|thumb|[[Rojava]] is supporting efforts for workers to form cooperatives, such as this sewing cooperative]]
At the end of World War II, the anarchist movement was severely weakened.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|p=xi}} However, the 1960s witnessed a revival of anarchism likely caused by a perceived failure of [[Marxism–Leninism]] and tensions built by the [[Cold War]].{{sfn|Marshall|1993|p=539}} During this time, anarchism took root in other movements critical to both the state and capitalism such as the [[Anti-nuclear movement|anti-nuclear]], [[Environmental movement|environmental]] and [[Peace movement|pacifist movements]], the [[New Left]], and the [[counterculture of the 1960s]].{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=xi, 539}} Anarchism became associated with [[punk subculture]] as exemplified by bands such as [[Crass]] and the [[Sex Pistols]],{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=493–494}} and the established [[feminist]] tendencies of [[anarcha-feminism]] returned with vigour during the [[second wave of feminism]].{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=556–557}}

Around the turn of the 21st century, anarchism grew in popularity and influence within [[anti-war]], [[anti-capitalist]] and [[anti-globalisation movement]]s.{{sfn|Rupert|2006|p=66}} Anarchists became known for their involvement in protests against the [[World Trade Organization]], [[Group of Eight]] and [[World Economic Forum]]. During the protests, ''ad hoc'' leaderless anonymous cadres known as [[black bloc]]s engaged in [[riot]]ing, [[property destruction]] and violent confrontations with the [[police]]. Other organisational tactics pioneered in this time include [[security culture]], [[affinity group]]s and the use of decentralised technologies such as the internet. A significant event of this period was the confrontations at the [[1999 Seattle WTO protests|WTO conference in Seattle in 1999]].{{sfn|Rupert|2006|p=66}} Anarchist ideas have been influential in the development of the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatistas]] in Mexico and the Democratic Federation of Northern Syria, more commonly known as [[Rojava]], a ''de facto'' [[Permanent autonomous zone|autonomous region]] in northern [[Syria]].{{sfn|Ramnath|2019|p=691}}

== Thought ==
{{main|Anarchist schools of thought}}
[[Anarchist schools of thought]] have been generally grouped in two main historical traditions, [[social anarchism]] and [[individualist anarchism]], owing to their different origins, values and evolution.{{sfnm|1a1=McLean|1a2=McMillan|1y=2003|1loc=&quot;Anarchism&quot;|2a1=Ostergaard|2y=2003|2p=14|2loc=&quot;Anarchism&quot;}} The individualist current emphasises [[negative liberty]] in opposing restraints upon the free individual, while the social current emphasises [[positive liberty]] in aiming to achieve the free potential of society through equality and [[social ownership]].{{sfn|Harrison|Boyd|2003|p=251}} In a chronological sense, anarchism can be segmented by the classical currents of the late 19th century, and the post-classical currents (such as [[anarcha-feminism]], [[green anarchism]] and [[post-anarchism]]) developed thereafter.{{sfn|Levy|Adams|2019|p=9}}

Beyond the specific factions of anarchist movements which constitute the political anarchism lies [[philosophical anarchism]], which holds that the state lacks moral legitimacy, without necessarily accepting the imperative of revolution to eliminate it.{{sfn|Egoumenides|2014|p=2}} A component especially of individualist anarchism,{{sfnm|1a1=Ostergaard|1y=2006|1p=12|2a1=Gabardi|2y=1986|2pp=300–302}} philosophical anarchism may tolerate the existence of a [[minimal state]], but argues that citizens have no [[moral obligation]] to obey government when it conflicts with individual autonomy.{{sfn|Klosko|2005|p=4}} Anarchism pays much attention to moral arguments since ethics have a central role in anarchist's philosophy.{{sfn|Franks|2019|p=549}}

One reaction against [[sectarianism]] within the anarchist milieu was [[anarchism without adjectives]], a call for [[toleration]] and unity among anarchists first adopted by [[Fernando Tarrida del Mármol]] in 1889 in response to the bitter debates of anarchist theory at the time.{{sfn|Avrich|1996|p=6}} Despite separation, the various anarchist schools of thought are not seen as distinct entities, but as tendencies that intermingle.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=1–6}}

Anarchism is usually placed on the [[Far-left politics|far-left]] of the [[political spectrum]].{{sfnm|1a1=Brooks|1y=1994|1p=xi|2a1=Kahn|2y=2000|3a1=Moynihan|3y=2007}} Much of its [[Anarchist economics|economics]] and [[Anarchist law|legal philosophy]] reflect [[anti-authoritarian]], [[anti-statist]] and [[libertarian]] interpretations of [[Political radicalism|radical]] [[left-wing]] and [[socialist]] politics{{sfn|Guerin|1970|p=12|ps=: &quot;[A]narchism is really a synonym for socialism. The anarchist is primarily a socialist whose aim is to abolish the exploitation of man by man. Anarchism is only one of the streams of socialist thought, that stream whose main components are concern for liberty and haste to abolish the State.&quot;}} of [[Collectivist anarchism|collectivism]], [[Anarcho-communism|communism]], [[Individualist anarchism|individualism]], [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]] and [[Anarcho-syndicalism|syndicalism]], among other [[libertarian socialist]] economic theories.{{sfn|Guerin|1970|p=35|loc=&quot;Critique of authoritarian socialism&quot;|ps=: &quot;The anarchists were unanimous in subjecting authoritarian socialism to a barrage of severe criticism. At the time when they made violent and satirical attacks these were not entirely well founded, for those to whom they were addressed were either primitive or &quot;vulgar&quot; communists, whose thought had not yet been fertilized by Marxist humanism, or else, in the case of Marx and Engels themselves, were not as set on authority and state control as the anarchists made out.&quot;}} As anarchism does not offer a fixed body of doctrine from a single particular worldview,{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=14–17}} many [[History of anarchism|anarchist types and traditions]] exist and varieties of anarchy diverge widely.{{sfn|Sylvan|2007|p=262}}

=== Classical ===
[[File:Portrait of Pierre Joseph Proudhon 1865.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], the primary proponent of [[Mutualism (economic theory)|anarcho-mutualism]], who influenced many future [[Individualist anarchism|individualist anarchist]] and [[Social anarchism|social anarchist]] thinkers{{sfn|Wilbur|2019|p=216-218}}]]

Inceptive currents among classical anarchist currents were [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]] and [[Individualist anarchism|individualism]]. They were followed by the major currents of social anarchism ([[Collectivist anarchism|collectivist]], [[Anarcho-communism|communist]] and [[Anarcho-syndicalism|syndicalist]]). They differ on organizational and economic aspects of their ideal society.{{sfn|Levy|Adams|2019|p=2}}

[[Mutualism (economic theory)|Mutualism]] is an 18th-century economic theory that was developed into anarchist theory by [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]]. Its aims include [[Reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocity]], [[Free association (Marxism and anarchism)|free association]], voluntary [[contract]], [[federation]], and [[Monetary reform|credit and currency reform]] that would be regulated by a bank of the people.{{sfn|Wilbur|2019|pp=213–218}} Mutualism has been retrospectively characterised as ideologically situated between individualist and collectivist forms of anarchism.{{sfnm|1a1=Avrich|1y=1996|1p=6|2a1=Miller|2y=1991|2p=11}} Proudhon first characterised his goal as a &quot;third form of society, the synthesis of communism and property&quot;.{{sfn|Pierson|2013|p=187|ps=.

[[Collectivist anarchism]], also known as anarchist collectivism or anarcho-collectivism,{{sfn|Morris|1993|p=76}} is a [[revolutionary socialist]] form of anarchism commonly associated with [[Mikhail Bakunin]].{{sfn|Shannon|2019|p=101}} Collectivist anarchists advocate [[collective ownership]] of the means of production, theorised to be achieved through violent revolution,{{sfn|Avrich|1996|pp=3–4}} and that workers be paid according to time worked, rather than goods being distributed according to need as in communism. Collectivist anarchism arose alongside [[Marxism]], but rejected the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] despite the stated Marxist goal of a collectivist [[stateless society]].{{sfnm|1a1=Heywood|1y=2017|1pp=146–147|2a1=Bakunin|2y=1990|2ps=: &quot;They [the Marxists] maintain that only a dictatorship—their dictatorship, of course—can create the will of the people, while our answer to this is: No dictatorship can have any other aim but that of self-perpetuation, and it can beget only slavery in the people tolerating it; freedom can be created only by freedom, that is, by a universal rebellion on the part of the people and free organization of the toiling masses from the bottom up.&quot;}} [[Anarcho-communism]], also known as anarchist-communism, communist anarchism and libertarian communism, is a theory of anarchism that advocates a [[communist society]] with [[common ownership]] of the means of production,{{sfn|Mayne|1999|p=131}} [[direct democracy]], and a [[Horizontalidad|horizontal network]] of [[voluntary association]]s and [[workers' council]]s with production and consumption based on the guiding principle: &quot;[[From each according to his ability, to each according to his need]]&quot;.{{sfnm|1a1=Marshall|1y=1993|1p=327|2a1=Turcato|2y=2019|2pp=237–323}} Anarcho-communism developed from radical socialist currents after the [[French Revolution]],{{sfn|Graham|2005}} but it was first formulated as such in the Italian section of the [[First International]].{{sfn|Pernicone|2009|pp=111–113}} It was later expanded upon in the theoretical work of [[Peter Kropotkin]].{{sfn|Turcato|2019|p=239–244}}

[[Anarcho-syndicalism]], also referred to as revolutionary syndicalism, is a branch of anarchism that views [[labour syndicate]]s as a potential force for revolutionary social change, replacing capitalism and the state with a new society democratically self-managed by workers. The basic principles of anarcho-syndicalism are workers' [[solidarity]], [[direct action]] and [[workers' self-management]].{{sfn|van der Walt|2019|p=249}}

[[Individualist anarchism]] refers to several traditions of thought within the anarchist movement that emphasise the [[individual]] and their [[Will (philosophy)|will]] over any kinds of external determinants.{{sfn|Ryley|2019|p=225}}  Early influences on individualist forms of anarchism include [[William Godwin]], [[Max Stirner]] and [[Henry David Thoreau]]. Through many countries, individualist anarchism attracted a small yet diverse following of Bohemian artists and intellectuals{{sfn|Marshall|1993|p=440}} as well as young anarchist outlaws in what became known as [[illegalism]] and [[individual reclamation]].{{sfnm|1a1=Imrie|1y=1994|2a1=Parry|2y=1987|2p=15}}

=== Post-classical and contemporary ===
{{main|Contemporary anarchism}}
[[File:Jarach and Zerzan.JPG|thumb|[[Lawrence Jarach]] (left) and [[John Zerzan]] (right), two prominent [[Contemporary anarchism|contemporary anarchist]] authors, with Zerzan being a prominent voice within [[anarcho-primitivism]] and Jarach a noted advocate of [[post-left anarchy]]]]

Anarchist principles undergird contemporary radical social movements of the left. Interest in the anarchist movement developed alongside momentum in the [[anti-globalization movement]],{{sfn|Evren|2011|p=1}} whose leading activist networks were anarchist in orientation.{{sfn|Evren|2011|p=2}} As the movement shaped 21st century radicalism, wider embrace of anarchist principles signaled a revival of interest.{{sfn|Evren|2011|p=2}} Contemporary news coverage which emphasizes [[black bloc]] demonstrations has reinforced anarchism's historical association with chaos and violence, although its publicity has also led more scholars to engage with the anarchist movement.{{sfn|Evren|2011|p=1}} Anarchism has continued to generate many philosophies and movements—at times eclectic, drawing upon various sources, and [[Syncretic politics|syncretic]], combining disparate concepts to create new philosophical approaches.{{sfn|Perlin|1979}} The [[anti-capitalist]] tradition of classical anarchism has remained prominent within contemporary currents.{{sfn|Williams|2018|p=4}}

Various anarchist groups, tendencies and schools of thought exist today, making it difficult to describe contemporary anarchist movement.{{sfn|Franks|2013|pp=385–386}} While theorists and activists have established &quot;relatively stable constellations of anarchist principles&quot;, there is no consensus on which principles are core. As a result, commentators describe multiple &quot;anarchisms&quot; (rather than a singular &quot;anarchism&quot;) in which common principles are shared between schools of anarchism while each group prioritizes those principles differently. For example, gender equality can be a common principle but ranks as a higher priority to [[anarcha-feminists]] than [[anarchist communists]].{{sfn|Franks|2013|p=386}} Anarchists are generally committed against coercive authority in the following forms, namely &quot;all centralized and hierarchical forms of government (e.g., monarchy, representative democracy, state socialism, etc.), economic class systems (e.g., capitalism, Bolshevism, feudalism, slavery, etc.), autocratic religions (e.g., fundamentalist Islam, Roman Catholicism, etc.), patriarchy, heterosexism, white supremacy, and imperialism&quot;.{{sfn|Jun|2009|pp=507–508}} However, anarchist schools disagree on the methods by which these forms should be opposed.{{sfn|Jun|2009|p=507}}

== Tactics ==
Anarchists' tactics take various forms but in general serve two major goals—first, to oppose [[the Establishment]]; and second, to promote anarchist ethics and reflect an anarchist vision of society, illustrating the unity of means and ends.{{sfn|Williams|2019|pp=107–108}} A broad categorization can be made between aims to destroy oppressive states and institutions by revolutionary means, and aims to change society through evolutionary means.{{sfn|Williams|2018|pp=4–5}} Evolutionary tactics reject violence and take a gradual approach to anarchist aims, though there is significant overlap between the two.{{sfn|Kinna|2019|p=125}}

Anarchist tactics have shifted during the course of the last century. Anarchists during the early 20th century focused more on strikes and militancy, while contemporary anarchists use a broader array of approaches.{{sfn|Williams|2019|p=112}}

=== Classical era tactics ===
[[File:McKinleyAssassination.jpg|thumb|The relationship between [[anarchism and violence]] is a controversial subject among anarchists. Pictured is [[Leon Czolgosz]] [[assassination of William McKinley|assassinating U.S. President William McKinley]].]]
During the classical era, anarchists had a militant tendency. Not only did they confront state armed forces (as in [[Spain]] and [[Ukraine]]) but some of them also employed [[terrorism]] as [[propaganda of the deed]]. Assassination attempts were carried out against heads of state, some of which were successful. Anarchists also took part in [[revolution]]s.{{sfn|Williams|2019|pp=112–113}} Anarchist perspectives towards violence have always been perplexing and controversial.{{sfn|Carter|1978|p=320}} On one hand, anarcho-pacifists point out the unity of means and ends.{{sfn|Fiala|2017}} On the other hand, other anarchist groups advocate direct action, a tactic which can include acts of [[sabotage]] or even acts of terrorism. This attitude was quite prominent a century ago; seeing the state as a [[tyrant]], some anarchists believed that they had every right to oppose its [[oppression]] by any means possible.{{sfn|Kinna|2019|pp=116–117}} [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Errico Malatesta]], who were proponents of limited use of violence, argued that violence is merely a reaction to state violence as a [[necessary evil]].{{sfn|Carter|1978|pp=320–325}}

Anarchists took an active role in [[Strike action|strikes]], although they tended to be antipathetic to formal [[syndicalism]], seeing it as reformist. They saw it as a part of the movement which sought to overthrow the [[State (polity)|state]] and [[capitalism]].{{sfn|Williams|2019|p=113}} Anarchists also reinforced their propaganda within the arts, some of whom practiced [[Naturism|nudism]]. They also built communities which were based on [[friendship]]. They were also involved in the [[News media|press]].{{sfn|Williams|2019|p=114}}

=== Revolutionary tactics ===
In the current era, Italian anarchist [[Alfredo Bonanno]], a proponent of [[insurrectionary anarchism]], has reinstated the debate on violence by rejecting the nonviolence tactic adopted since the late 19th century by Kropotkin and other prominent anarchists afterwards. Both Bonanno and the French group [[The Invisible Committee]] advocate for small, informal affiliation groups, where each member is responsible for their own actions but works together to bring down oppression utilizing sabotage and other violent means against state, capitalism and other enemies. Members of The Invisible Committee were arrested in 2008 on various charges, terrorism included.{{sfn|Kinna|2019|pp=134–135}}

Overall, today's anarchists are much less violent and militant than their ideological ancestors. They mostly engage in confronting the police during demonstrations and riots, especially in countries like [[Anarchism in Canada|Canada]], [[Anarchism in Mexico|Mexico]] or [[Anarchism in Greece|Greece]]. Μilitant [[black bloc]] protest groups are known for clashing with the police.{{sfn|Williams|2019|p=115}} However, anarchists not only clash with state operators; they also engage in the struggle against fascists and racists, taking [[Post-World War II anti-fascism|antifa action]] and mobilizing to prevent hate rallies from happening.{{sfn|Williams|2019|p=117}}

=== Evolutionary tactics ===
Anarchists commonly employ [[direct action]]. This can take the form of disrupting and protesting against unjust [[hierarchy]], or the form of self-managing their lives through the creation of counterinstitutions such as communes and non-hierarchical collectives.{{sfn|Williams|2018|pp=4–5}} Often decision-making is handled in an anti-authoritarian way, with everyone having equal say in each decision, an approach known as [[Horizontalidad|horizontalism]].{{sfn|Williams|2019|pp=109–117}} Contemporary-era anarchists have been engaging with various grass root movements that are not explicitly anarchist but are more or less based on horizontalism, respecting personal autonomy and participating in mass activism such as strikes and demonstrations. The newly coined term &quot;small-a anarchism&quot;, in contrast with &quot;big-A anarchism&quot; of the classical era, signals their tendency not to base their thoughts and actions on classical-era anarchism or to refer to Kropotkin or Proudhon to justify their opinions. They would rather base their thought and praxis on their own experience, which they will later theorize.{{sfn|Kinna|2019|pp=145–149}}

The decision-making process of small affinity anarchist groups play a significant tactical role.{{sfn|Williams|2019|pp=109, 119}} Anarchists have employed various methods in order to build a rough consensus among members of their group, without the need of a leader or a leading group. One way is for an individual from the group to play the role of facilitator to help achieve a consensus without taking part in the discussion themselves or promoting a specific point. Minorities usually accept rough consensus, except when they feel the proposal contradicts anarchist goals, values or ethics. Anarchists usually form small groups (5–20 individuals) to enhance autonomy and friendships among their members. These kind of groups more often than not interconnect with each other, forming larger networks. Anarchists still support and participate in strikes, especially [[Wildcat strike action|wildcat strikes]]; these are leaderless strikes not organised centrally by a syndicate.{{sfn|Williams|2019|p=119–121}}

Anarchists have gone [[World Wide Web|online]] to spread their message. As in the past, newspapers and journals are used; however, because of distributional and other difficulties, anarchists have found it easier to create websites, hosting electronic libraries and other portals.{{sfn|Williams|2019|pp=118–119}} Anarchists were also involved in developing various software that are available for free. The way these hacktivists work to develop and distribute resembles the anarchist ideals, especially when it comes to preserving user's privacy from state surveillance.{{sfn|Williams|2019|pp=120–121}}

Anarchists organize themselves to squat and reclaim public spaces. During important events such as protests and when spaces are being occupied, they are often called [[Temporary Autonomous Zone]]s (TAZ), spaces where surrealism, poetry and art are blended to display the anarchist ideal.{{sfnm|1a1=Kinna|1y=2019|1p=139|2a1=Mattern|2y=2019|2p=596|3a1=Williams|3y=2018|3pp=5–6}} As seen by anarchists, squatting is a way to regain urban space that capitalist market, serving pragmatical needs and is also seen an exemplary direct action.{{sfnm|1a1=Kinna|1y=2012|1p=250|2a1=Williams|2y=2019|2p=119}} Acquiring space enables anarchists to experiment with their ideas and build social bonds.{{sfn|Williams|2019|p=122}} Adding up these tactics and having in mind that not all anarchists share the same attitudes towards them, along with various forms of protesting at highly symbolic events, make up a [[Carnivalesque|carnivalesque atmosphere]] that is part of contemporary anarchism vividity.{{sfn|Morland|2004|p=37–38}}

== Key issues ==
{{main|Issues in anarchism}}
&lt;!-- In the interest of restricting article length, please limit this section to two or three short paragraphs and add any substantial information to the main Issues in anarchism article. Thank you. --&gt;
As anarchism is a [[philosophy]] that embodies many diverse attitudes, tendencies and schools of thought and disagreement over questions of values, ideology and tactics is common, its diversity has led to widely different use of identical terms among different anarchist traditions which has led to many [[definitional concerns in anarchist theory]]. For instance, the compatibility of [[Anarchism and capitalism|capitalism]],{{sfnm|1a1=Marshall|1y=1993|1p=565|1ps=: &quot;In fact, few anarchists would accept the 'anarcho-capitalists' into the anarchist camp since they do not share a concern for economic equality and social justice, Their self-interested, calculating market men would be incapable of practising voluntary co-operation and mutual aid. Anarcho-capitalists, even if they do reject the State, might therefore best be called right-wing libertarians rather than anarchists.&quot;|2a1=Honderich|2y=1995|2p=31|3a1=Meltzer|3y=2000|3p=50|3ps=: &quot;The philosophy of &quot;anarcho-capitalism&quot; dreamed up by the &quot;libertarian&quot; [[New Right]], has nothing to do with Anarchism as known by the Anarchist movement proper.&quot;|4a1=Goodway|4y=2006|4p=4|4ps=: &quot;'Libertarian' and 'libertarianism' are frequently employed by anarchists as synonyms for 'anarchist' and 'anarchism', largely as an attempt to distance themselves from the negative connotations of 'anarchy' and its derivatives. The situation has been vastly complicated in recent decades with the rise of anarcho-capitalism, 'minimal statism' and an extreme right-wing laissez-faire philosophy advocated by such theorists as Murray Rothbard and Robert Nozick and their adoption of the words 'libertarian' and 'libertarianism'. It has therefore now become necessary to distinguish between their right libertarianism and the left libertarianism of the anarchist tradition.&quot;|5a1=Newman|5y=2010|5p=53|5ps=: &quot;It is important to distinguish between anarchism and certain strands of right-wing libertarianism which at times go by the same name (for example, Murray Rothbard's anarcho-capitalism).&quot;}} [[Anarchism and nationalism|nationalism]] and [[Anarchism and religion|religion]] with anarchism is widely disputed. Similarly, anarchism enjoys complex relationships with ideologies such as [[Anarchism and Marxism|Marxism]], [[Issues in anarchism#Communism|communism]], [[collectivism]] and [[trade unionism]]. Anarchists may be motivated by [[humanism]], [[God|divine authority]], [[enlightened self-interest]], [[Veganarchism|veganism]], or any number of alternative ethical doctrines. Phenomena such as [[civilisation]], [[technology]] (e.g. within [[anarcho-primitivism]]) and the [[Issues in anarchism#Participation in statist democracy|democratic process]] may be sharply criticised within some anarchist tendencies and simultaneously lauded in others.{{sfn|De George|2005|pp=31–32}}

=== Gender, sexuality and free love ===
{{main|Free love}}
{{see also|Anarchism and issues related to love and sex|Queer anarchism}}
[[File:Emilearmand01.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Individualist anarchism in France|French individualist anarchist]] [[Émile Armand]] propounded the virtues of [[free love]] in the [[Anarchism in France|Parisian anarchist milieu]] of the early 20th century]]

Gender and sexuality carry along them dynamics of hierarchy; anarchism is obliged to address, analyse and oppose the suppression of one's autonomy because of the dynamics that gender roles traditionally impose.{{sfn|Nicholas|2019|p=603}}

A historical current that arose and flourished during 1890 and 1920 within anarchism was [[free love]] and in a way it still survives as tendency supporting polyamory and queer anarchism.{{sfnm|1a1=Nicholas|1y=2019|1p=611|2a1=Jeppesen|2a2=Nazar|2y=2012|2pp=175–176}} Free love advocates were against marriage which saw as a way of men imposing authority over women because of marriage laws giving the upper hand to males. The notion of free love though was much broader, it was a critique to the whole established order that limited women from sexual freedom and pleasure.{{sfn|Jeppesen|Nazar|2012|pp=175–176}} This movement became close to reality as there have been various household that hosted many comrades sharing a common bed.{{sfn|Jeppesen|Nazar|2012|p=177}} Free love had roots both in Europe and the United States. Some anarchists soon found out that free love wasn't without adverse effects as jealously arose.{{sfn|Jeppesen|Nazar|2012|pp=175–177}} Anarchist feminists were advocates of free love, against marriage, pro-choice (utilizing a contemporary term) and had a likewise agenda.  Anarchist and non-anarchist feminists differed on suffrage, but still they were supportive of each other.{{sfn|Kinna2019|pp=166–167}}

During the second half of the 20th century, anarchism intermingled with the second wave of anarchism, radicalizing some currents of the feminist movement-and got influenced as well. By the latest decades of the 20th century, anarchist and feminists were advocating for rights and autonomy of women, gays, queers and other marginalized groups with some feminist thinkers suggesting the fusion of the two currents.{{sfn|Nicholas|2019|pp=609–611}} With the third wave of anarchism, sexual identity and compulsory heterosexuality were put under the anarchist's microscope and yielded a post-structuralist critique of sexual normality.{{sfn|Nicholas|2019|pp=610–611}} However, some anarchists distanced themselves from this line of thinking, suggesting it is leaning towards individualism and therefore dropping the cause of social liberation.{{sfn|Nicholas|2019|pp=616–617}}

Anarchist's interest to education stretches back to the first steps of classical anarchism. Anarchists see proper education that sets the foundations of the future autonomy of the individual and society, as an act of mutual aid.{{sfnm|1a1=Kinna|1y=2019|1pp=83–85|2a2=Suissa|2y=2019|2pp=514–515, 520}} Anarchists writers such as Willian Godwin and Max Stirner attacked both state orchestrated public education and elitist education as they saw it as another way for the ruling class to replicate their privileges.{{sfnm|1a1=Suissa|1y=2019|1pp=514, 521|2a1=Kinna|2y=2019|2pp=83–86|3a1=Marshall|3y=1993|3p=222|3ps=. Max Stirner recorded his thoughts in an essay on education titled &quot;[[The False Principle of Our Education]]&quot;. William Godwin's thoughts can be found in his ''[[Political Justice]]''.}}

In 1901, Catalan anarchist and free thinker [[Francisco Ferrer]] established the [[Ferrer movement|modern]] in Barcelona in defiance of an educational system controlled by the Catholic Church.{{sfn|Suissa|2019|pp=511–512}} Ferrer's approach was secular, rejecting both the state and church involvement in the educational process and gave pupils plenty of autonomy (i.e. on setting the curriculum). Ferrer was aiming to educate the working class. The school closed after constant harassment by the state and Ferrer was later on arrested. Ferrer's ideas generally formed the inspiration for a series of [[Modern School (United States)|modern schools]] around the world.{{sfn|Suissa|2019|pp=511–514}} Christian anarchist [[Leo Tolstoy]] had also established a school, it 's major principle was &quot;for education to be effective it had to be free&quot;, as Tolstoy himself explained.{{sfn|Suissa|2019|pp=517–518|ps=. For more, see Tolstoy essay's ''Education and Culture''.}} In a similar token, A. S. Neill founding what became [[Summerhill School]] in 1921, also declaring being free from coercion.{{sfn|Suissa|2019|pp=518–519}} All anarchist schools were based mostly on a moral value, namely respecting children's right to develop freely without manipulations. However, they faced the dilemma of whether they should guide youngsters towards political and class struggles. Most anarchist educators of early 20th century did not take a neutral stance; the specific question kept troubling anarchist the decades to come.{{sfn|Suissa|2019|pp=519-522}} Some decades later, anarchist authors such Colin Ward, Hearbert Read and Paul Goodman intensified and expanded anarchist's critique to state education, even the need for schooling as a pedagogical method, suggesting a system that would focus on children's creativity rather than turning them into career-hunters.{{sfn|Kinna|2019|pp=89–96}}

While not many anarchists schools survived to the current era, major tenets of anarchists schools, such as respect for child autonomy and freedom, relying on reasoning rather than indoctrination, have spread in mainstream educational institutions portraying themselves as democratic.{{sfn|Suissa|2019|pp=523–526|ps=. Suissa names three schools as explicitly anarchists schools, namely the Free Skool Santa Cruz in the United States which is part of a wider American-Canadian network of schools; Self-Managed Learning College in Brighton, England; and P
